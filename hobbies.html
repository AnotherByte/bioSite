                    <p>I started collecting stamps when I was 14. My mother was originally from Italy and the rest of her family still lives there. My cousin and I began writing letters to each other as pen pals. She had been collecting stamps for some time and had asked me to send her some from the USA. When I did, she sent back some from Italy and other European countries that she had extras of and that was the beginning of my collection.</p>
                    <p>As I grew up and moved out, I got rid of my original collection at some point. About five years ago, I came across some stamps at a rummage sale and decided to start collecting them again. Since then my collection has grown much larger than it ever was when I was young. I have over 35 shoe boxes of stamps all organized by country. For USA stamps, I have seven books all broken down by year. The stamps I have are placed in the book using hinges that hold the stamp in place, but allow for them to be removed without damaging the stamp, if needed.</p>

                    <p>Yes I do. In a similar way to my stamp collection, I came across a box of Pez at a rummage sale. I knew some people had collected them and I thought it would be a fun thing to do. This was several years before I had started collecting stamps again. I knew Pez were still being sold in stores with new dispensers coming out all the time. They were a small, cheaper item to collect and would be fun looking around for when I would go out shopping. Little did I know how big my collection would become.</p>
                    <p>I have well over 1,000 individual dispensers, mostly still in the package, plus hundreds of other officially licensed items such as pens, t-shirts, bobble-heads, and many more. Many of my older, original dispensers are in a display cabinet, but the newer parts of my collection are in plastic totes. While many new dispensers are sold in all types of retail stores here in the USA, there are certain ones that are only available in other countries. I am a part of many collectors groups that sell and trade the ones that members need. If I can't find what I need there, I do use Ebay to get them.</p>

                    <p>Every weekend that I can, and any time I can during the work week, I enjoy going out for bicycle rides. Usually my shorter rides during the week are around 10 miles and on the weekends I do somewhere between 20 and 30 miles. I use an app called Strava that keeps track of all kinds of data during my ride. It maps out my path, keeps track of the milage, time, and speed, and can compare my stats with other users. My speed hovers around 10 miles an hour, which I think is pretty good for someone my age! I'm no professional rider or anything, I just do it for fun and a bit of exercise. Its fun traveling to different cities and trails and seeing the buildings and nature in a different way. Getting some fresh air on nice spring and summer days is a really enjoyable way to spend my free time. Plus, doing some shopping afterwards is a nice treat.</p>
                    <p>There is a really nice trail in Green Bay that goes along the East River. It weaves its way through many parks on that side of town. There is a problem with the river over flowing and flooding on the trail which is a real bummer. Its hard to know if the river will be an issue until you are already on the trail and having to turn around and find somewhere else to go really sucks. The trail in Stevens Point is another great one. That trail also goes from park to park in the city with little residential streets inbetween. It is a nice change of pace going from city streets with houses all around one minute and then it turns into a dirt trail in the middle of a forest the next. The Stevens Point trail is also a loop so you don't have to stop at the end and turn around to get back to the car.</p>
